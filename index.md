# Welcome

Whether I've lured you here by means of Social Engineering or you're just bored, I hope you find some value out of the site.

I highly encourage and welcome feedback, tell me what you want to see and what I am doing wrong.

I share my thoughts on topics involving Splunk, Cybersecurity, Syslog, and much more :)
